# done
* rails new
* bundle into `./.gems`
* bundle add ruby_llm

# now
* check the ruby_llm gem for inspiration on writing some sample code to check that we have openrouter set up correctly
  * doesn't appear to support open router, whomp whomp
  * so what's the path forward
  * I guess leave the gem installed, and ignore it for now while we continue by using a class we implement to wrap simply around openrouter and leave it at that

# next
* set up an openrouter key

# soon
* plan out a telegram api interaction
